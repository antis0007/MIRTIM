# MIRTIN: Music is reversible, Time is not
Relatively simple YT-DLP and FFMPEG based Discord Music Bot made with discord.py

## Features:
* Can stream music from Youtube search queries or URLs
* Song queue system with additional functions
* Supports loading spotify songs/playlists into queue
* Supports live FFMPEG audio filters with simplified aliases
* Audio Reversal (WIP, ironic)
* Audio Seeking  (WIP)

	
## Setup:
Simply use the provided dependency installer to get the required packages, then provide your discord bot token in /MIRTIN/token.txt

I reccomend you get FFMPEG installed on your system and added to PATH (not sure if the bot works with the python FFMPEG package alone)
